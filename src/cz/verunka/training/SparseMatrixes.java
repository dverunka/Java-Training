/*
    Design a simple storage mechanism for sparse matrixes of integers (ie matrixes that have only very few non-zero elements but can be potentially large).
    Implement two methods on such matrixes:

    update matrix value at a given row and column:
    void set(int row, int col, int val)
    return the sum of values from the top left corner to the given row, column sub-matrix

    int sum(int row, int col)
    Assume all indices in the methods are zero-based.

    Example:

    Matrix A =  ( 0 3 0 0 )
                ( 1 0 0 0 )
                ( 0 0 4 -1)
                ( 0 1 0 0 )

    set(0,1,5) on A =   ( 0 5 0 0 )
                        ( 1 0 0 0 )
                        ( 0 0 4 -1)
                        ( 0 1 0 0 )

    sum(2,2) on A = 8 // =1+3+4
